# Football-League-Managements-System
The Football League Management System is a relational database project designed to manage the data of football teams, players, coaches, and stadiums. It aims to provide a resource for me to learn relational database and SQL coding. It organize a dummy football league, tracking team rosters, coaches, and other relevant information.
